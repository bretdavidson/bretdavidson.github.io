# Code4Lib 2016

## Note
Workshop materials for the lodash JavaScript library presented at Code4Lib 2016.

## lodash.js API Tour

The goal of the lodash.js koans is to orient you to the [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
JavaScript library through automated testing. When you first run the koans,
you'll be presented with a runtime error and a stack trace indicating where the
error occurred. Your goal is to make the error go away. As you fix each error,
you should learn something about the lodash.js library.

## Orientation

1. Navigate to the `code4lib_javascript_workshop` folder and open `KoansRunnnerJS.html`.

2. The first error will be in `koans/js/AboutExpects.js`. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser.

3. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

## Running the Koans

After completing `koans/js/AboutExpects.js`, open `KoansRunnerLoDash.html` and `koans/lodash/AboutCollectionMethods.js` to begin the lodash.js API tour.
