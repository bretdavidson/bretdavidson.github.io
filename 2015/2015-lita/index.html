For example, do we need a computer programmer with such and such skills. <strong>I’m sure you have good documentation available, however, we would like to talk with someone.</strong>  We are also curious as to how much time it would take to get SUMA working for us.  <strong>I am not sure we have the expertise in-house.</strong>"</p>

The conferees also believed that it would be useful to have a single label that identified this approach and distinguished it from the philosophically- and politically-focused label "free software." Brainstorming for this new label eventually converged on the term "open source", originally suggested by Christine Peterson."</p></blockquote>
